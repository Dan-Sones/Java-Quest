<h3>Why this Project?</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>At the point of this readme being written</strong> (27th April 2020) I'm just Getting started with java so It Needs to be simple...</li>
<li>I have the oppurtunity to use alot of my newly acquired oop knowledge in a practical enviroment.</li>
<li>Games are always fun!</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>28th April 2020 A</strong> -- When entering a fight the user now has an option to run away from the battle, on doing this they enter a town. This town can either be an enemy town or an allying town. If it is an enemy town there is a chance of you losing 10 health! If It's an allying town you could refill your armour or be healed! </li>
  
  <li> <strong>28th April 2020 B</strong> -- This update adds The ability to encounter a prisoner being kept in a tower. The user will be given the option to either save then (and risk there lives ;) ) or carry on and ignore them. </li>
  
  <li><Strong>1st May 2020</strong> -- Added Dragon battles. These are very simple and It's highly likely that I'll rework this in the not to distant future as it not what I imagined it to be when starting out this project</li>
  
</ul>

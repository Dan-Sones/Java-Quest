<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>28th April 2020 A</strong> -- When entering a fight the user now has an option to run away from the battle, on doing this they enter a town. This town can either be an enemy town or an allying town. If it is an enemy town there is a chance of you losing 10 health! If It's an allying town you could refill your armour or be healed! </li>
  
  <li> <strong>28th April 2020 B</strong> -- This update adds The ability to encounter a prisoner being kept in a tower. The user will be given the option to either save then (and risk there lives ;) ) or carry on and ignore them. </li>
  
</ul>
